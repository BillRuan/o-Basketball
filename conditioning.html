    <h1>YOU WANNA HAVE MORE EFFICIENCY AND VERSATILITY?</h1>
<p>
In order to achieve success and be useful on the court, proper conditioning is fundamental to surviving and mobility/power.
Running at a fast pace and jumping is basic prerequisites, so HIIT and cardio is a good way to train endurance.
Juking, spinning, all kinds of moves are important too, so training your legs and ankles it a very good fundamental.
Since jumping is used in almost all techniques to score, training the muscle fibers and fast-twitch muscles are a good
area to target for increased bounce. A good exercise for this is the box jump, which involves standing on a box, jumping off 
and then immediately leaping back up the instant you touch the floor. You want to train explosiveness and increase the 
amount force you exert on the ground when you jump. Good arms are good too, although you shouldn't weight train. Do
body exercises, such as push-ups to build inner body strength and flexibility. Having good arms will help you shoot 
ball further and make swifter passes. You also want to be able to push back, as your opponent will attempt to give you 
physical adversity. Last but not least, have a strong core. I'm not just talking about abdominals, but I'm also mentioning
obliques, multifidus, pelvic floor muscles, spine, hips, etc. These are all muscles that are the root base for mobility
with your limbs. Without a strong core, you can't exert more power/force. Also, once you finish conditioning your body,
don't forget to stretch. Stretching soothes and breaks the muscles down. This is a good thing, as it decreases tension
and the tendency to cramps. Stretching also improves flexibility, which is a huge factor to movement range and motion.
Be sure to eat lots of protein to help the body repair fibers, and don't forget to eat healthy in other food groups too.
Ice is a great way to help muscle, as using it will make the blood cells work and out your muscles into shock. This
allows muscles to repair faster. Other than that, don't use weights to lift, as it will damage growth plates and 
stunt your growth.
