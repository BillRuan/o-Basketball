        The game origninated on December 1891 by a Canadian named James Naismith.
         He was an instructor at YMCA training school in Springfield, Massachusetts.
          Mr. Naismith was asked to create an indoor game to keep students occupied because of the
           way the cold weather kept everyone indoors. In his diary, he wrote,
            "I felt this was a crucial moment in my life as it meant success or failure of my attempt
             to hold the interest of the class and devise a new game."
        He got inspiration from a game that he used to play called 'Duck on a Rock.' This game involved
         players throwing rocks at a targets placed on top of a large rock or a short tree stump. 
        With a little bit of brainstorming, he created the game basketball. The first game was played using
        very simple equipment. All they had to do was throw or bat a soccer ball into opposing peach baskets.
        However, since there weren't holes at the bottom of the baskets, they had to use a pole or a ladder to
        retrieve the ball out. There were also nine players on each team, as opposed to the the mandatory 
        count of five. To set boundaries, James established the original 13 rules of basketball.
        </p>
        <ol class="rules">
        <h5>1.</h5> "The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands."
        <br>
        <h5>2.</h5> "The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands, but never with the fist."
        <br>
        <h5>3.</h5> "The player cannot run with the ball. The player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, allowance to be made for a man running at good speed."  
        <br>
        <h5>4.</h5> "The ball must be held by the hands. The arms or body must not be used for holding it."
        <br>
        <h5>5.</h5> "No shouldering, holding, pushing, striking, or tripping in any way of an opponent. The first infringement of this rule by any person shall count as a foul; the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made or, if there is evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game. No substitution shall be allowed."
        <br>
        <h5>6.</h5> "A foul is striking at the ball with the fist, violations of Rule 3 and 4 and such as described in Rule 5."
        <br>
        <h5>7.</h5> "If either side makes three consecutive fouls it shall count as a goal for the opponents (consecutive means without the opponents in the meantime making a foul."
        <br>
        <h5>8.</h5> "A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from the grounds into the basket and stays there, providing those defending the goal do no touch or disturb the goal. If the ball rests on the edges, and the opponent moves the basket, it shall count as a goal."
        <br>
        <h5>9.</h5> "When the ball goes out of bounds, it shall be thrown into the field and played by the first person touching it. In case of dispute the umpire shall throw it straight into the field. The thrower-in is allowed five seconds. If he holds longer, it shall go to the opponent. If any sides persists in delaying the game, the umpire shall call a foul on them."
        <br>
        <h5>10.</h5> "The umpire shall be the judge of the men and shall note the fouls and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made. He shall have power to disqualify men according to Rule 5."
        <br>
        <h5>11.</h5> "The referee shall be the judge of the ball and decide when the ball is in play, in bounds, to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time. He shall decide when a goal has been made and keep account of the goals, with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee."
        <br>
        <h5>12.</h5> "The time shall be two fifteen-minute halves, with five minutes rest between."
        <br>
        <h5>13.</h5> "The side making the most goals in that time shall be declared the winner."
