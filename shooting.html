    <h1>THE PRIME SKILL TO WIN GAMES</h1>
<p>
Shooting is literally the only way to score points, but it can be hard if you don't have a platform down. 
The rim is two times wide the basketball diameter (official size) and it includes a backboard to bounce the ball 
off of.
However, there is a certain technique to throwing the ball so that the ball rolls in perfectly. 
You see, the rim has some potential elastic energy; it is extremely easy to bounce pseudo-elastic objeccts, 
such as balls. Henceforth, simply chucking the ball won't result in an accurate goal, unless you miraculously 
hit it at the right angle. The trajectory that one must throw is an arch, or parabola. This type of path is the best
and will result in best chances of getting a hit. In Layman's terms, the higher the ball goes, the bigger the hole because the hole flat. If you try to hit the hole from a slanted angle, 
it's more likely to get blocked by the rim rather than sliding into the hole. Now, that's only part of the shooting 
craft. Shooting form is fundamental too, as you can't achieve a parabolic trajectory without thr correct form.
In order to perform this, bend your legs. Bending legs is a great technique, as it makes you more explosive. You also
have access to JUMPING, which is mandatory when it comes to skill. Next, grab the ball with your dominant hand.
However, don't hold the ball with your whole hand. Only use your fingers to hold it. The ball shouldn't touch the palm.
The ball, however, shouldn't rest on the tips of the fingers either. Once you achieved this, use your eyes to look at the back of the rim. Your arm should naturally adjust accordingly to your vision.
Finally, jump. Jumping gives you a boost if you can't throw far enough, and launches the ball in a steeper trajectory.
One more thing: roll the ball off your hands so that the ball launches while spinning. You can 
also cause it to spin by snapping your wrist down and holding it in the air. This is FOLLOWING
THROUGH. It is mandatory to follow through so that the shot stays consistent the whol time. The ball MUST SPIN in order
to be able to slide into the basket. It must be rolling to minimize the force of the impact when the ball collides with the basket.
If it doesn't roll, the ball will strike the basket with the final velocity it's at, hitting it at a greater force.
This causes it to bounce right off, as the gravitational potential energy in the ball and the elastic potential energy
in the rim is too great for the ball to just lightly slide through.
